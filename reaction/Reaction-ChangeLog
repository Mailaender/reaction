- Calculate tangent space in fragment shader instead of storing per vertex
- Fix sun flare with sky portals.  Sun flare must be inside sky portal.
- Speed up tone mapping
- Add fast light shader path when r_normalMapping and r_specularMapping are 0
- Revise FBO blitting code (Still needs more work)
- Detect GLSL version
- Use GL_EXT_draw_range_elements
- Reserve FBOs before shaders, as recommended in nvidia docs
- Minor tweak in VBO allocation.
- Update tr_font.c to ioq3 latest (r2232)
- Minor image code cleanup.
- Added support for LATC(normalmaps) and BPTC(everything else) image compression
- Use faster framebuffer blits whenever possible.
- Optimized lightall shader for older hardware.
- Fixed case in GLSL_PrintInfoLog when log is 0 length.
- Clear render buffer on allocate, fixes corrupt screen issue
- Use GL_RGB16_F instead of GL_RGBA16_F for hdr render buffer
- Draw chat messages & co. during intermission
- Don't reserve render buffers when textures are used for a FBO.  Fixes a crash when GPU memory is at a premium.
* Beta 1 - Initial Public Release.
