- Changed com_zoneMegs to 128 (from 64)
- Adjust default auto-exposure a bit higher.
- Added .mtr file support.  .mtr files are just .shader files that are accessed first.
- Added support for q3gl2_sun shaderparm in sky shaders to control sun shadows
- Added r_shadowFilter 0/1/2 for cascaded shadow maps.
- Added sun shadow support cvars.
- Changed r_testSunlight to r_forceSun 0/1/2 and r_sunShadows 0/1.
- Spread in automatic weapons should be reduced in 3 burst mode.
- Updated the ioq3 base Reaction is based on to ioq3 svn version 2322
- Scale map lights by 0.66 and sunlight by 0.33 when r_testSunlight 1
- Offset shadowmap samples by surface normal and reenable PCF
- Reenabled per vertex tangent space values, fixes visual issues in normal maps
- Simplified some viewparms flags
- Add cascaded shadow mapping, test with r_testSunlight 1.
- Add r_depthPrepass.
- Improve parallax mapping
- Add AVG_MAP, BLACK_LEVEL, and WHITE_LEVEL defines to tonemap shader
- Fix a bug in fragment shader tangent space calculations
- Fix a bug in new curves code
- System menu makes a bit more sense now (removed irrelevant options, added new presets)
- Change imagelist cmd to give more relevant information
- Remove DiffuseRoughness shader param, add SpecularExponent shader param
- Change R_SubdividePatchToGrid() to subdivide patches more evenly
- Calculate tangent space in fragment shader instead of storing per vertex
- Fix sun flare with sky portals.  Sun flare must be inside sky portal.
- Speed up tone mapping
- Add fast light shader path when r_normalMapping and r_specularMapping are 0
- Revise FBO blitting code (Still needs more work)
- Detect GLSL version
- Use GL_EXT_draw_range_elements
- Reserve FBOs before shaders, as recommended in nvidia docs
- Minor tweak in VBO allocation.
- Update tr_font.c to ioq3 latest (r2232)
- Minor image code cleanup.
- Added support for LATC(normalmaps) and BPTC(everything else) image compression
- Use faster framebuffer blits whenever possible.
- Optimized lightall shader for older hardware.
- Fixed case in GLSL_PrintInfoLog when log is 0 length.
- Clear render buffer on allocate, fixes corrupt screen issue
- Use GL_RGB16_F instead of GL_RGBA16_F for hdr render buffer
- Draw chat messages & co. during intermission
- Don't reserve render buffers when textures are used for a FBO.  Fixes a crash when GPU memory is at a premium.
* Beta 1 - Initial Public Release.
